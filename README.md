This project is an exercise to develope a clean,minimal,use case robotic application refrence library for robotic applications.  For an actual live robot I suggest that the user explore other libraries which have been optimized for results on live robots ie (ROS).  This library is behing optimized for explanning concepts  and ease of use. 

Any questions can be directed to Trevor at my  email: MR.Trevor.Decker@gmail.com


The top level sections of this library are:

* Simulation
* Perception
* Estimation
* Planning
* Control

This model fits the robotics paradime of Sense, Plan, Act.  With Sense being covered by Simulation/Perception, Planning being covered by Estimation and Planning. And Action being covered by Control and Simulation.  

The Drivers folder contains programs that leverage the parts of the system to produce robotic applications
