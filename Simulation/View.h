// View reprsents a way of looking at part of the world after
// it has been projected and croped. 
// aka we have some input vector of information and a model for transforming 
// that information onto a 2d (x,y) plane within a particular domain for x and y 

class View{
  
  // initilizs or reinitilizes the view
  void init(){
    // TODO
  }
  
  // provides an incremental update to the current view of the world
  void update(){
    // TODO
  }
};
